# Inference Mode - Final Implementation

## ✅ Confirmed Approach: Single Agent Evaluation

Based on user preference and industry standards, the system uses **one frozen agent** for inference evaluation.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Training Mode (🧠)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Multiple Clients (1-100)        │
│ Each learning independently     │
│ Federation aggregates knowledge │
│                                 │
│ [Client 1] [Client 2]           │
│ [Client 3] [Client 4]           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Controls visible:**
- Clients: [4] input field
- Auto-Federate checkbox
- Start, Federate, Reset, Save, Export buttons

### Inference Mode (🎯)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Single Agent (frozen weights)  │
│ ε = 0 (greedy), α = 0 (no learn)│
│                                 │
│    [Single Canvas Display]      │
│                                 │
│ Runs N sequential episodes      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Controls visible:**
- Model Source: [Latest Training ▼]
- Test Episodes: [50 ▼]
- Run Evaluation, Stop buttons

**Controls HIDDEN:**
- Clients input (not relevant)
- Auto-Federate checkbox (no learning)
- Training-specific buttons

---

## 📊 Evaluation Methodology

### Standard Approach (Implemented)
1. Load trained model weights
2. Create frozen agent (ε=0, α=0)
3. Run N episodes sequentially
4. Aggregate statistics:
   - Mean reward: μ = Σ(rewards) / N
   - Std deviation: σ = √(Σ(r - μ)² / N)
   - Success rate: successes / N
   - Consistency: 1 - (σ / |μ|)

### Why Single Agent?
- **Deterministic policy**: ε=0 means always pick best action
- **Same weights** = same behavior
- **Environment stochasticity** captured over N episodes
- **Industry standard**: OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines3, research papers

### Episode Distribution
With stochastic environment (random ball positions):
```
Episode 1: reward = 12.3  (ball spawned left)
Episode 2: reward = 15.7  (ball spawned center)
Episode 3: reward = 11.2  (ball spawned right, fast)
...
Episode 50: reward = 14.1 (ball spawned center)

Mean: 13.4 ± 2.1
```

The variance comes from **environment randomness**, not agent randomness.

## 🔧 UI Implementation Details

### Mode Switching
```javascript
// When switching to inference:
1. Stop training animation
2. Save current model to localStorage
3. Hide training controls (clients input, federation)
4. Show inference controls (model selector, episodes)
5. Replace 4-client grid with single canvas
6. Setup inference UI components
```

### Visual Distinction
| Aspect | Training Mode | Inference Mode |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Theme | Blue (#3b82f6) | Green (#10b981) |
| Icon | 🧠 | 🎯 |
| Canvas | 2×2 grid (4 clients) | Single centered canvas |
| Controls | Start/Federate/Reset | Run/Stop |
| Inputs | Clients (1-100) | Episodes (10/25/50/100) |
| Learning | Yes (ε, α > 0) | No (ε=0, α=0) |

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Duplicate Pause Button ✅
**Problem**: Two pause buttons showed up
**Cause**: Separate btn-pause in button array
**Fix**: Removed btn-pause, Start button toggles (Start ↔ Pause)

### Issue #2: Inference Not Starting ✅
**Problem**: "Run Evaluation" button did nothing
**Cause**: JavaScript hoisting - functions called before definition
**Fix**: Moved `startInference()` and helpers before `setupInferenceUI()`

### Issue #3: Client Count Confusion ✅
**Problem**: User saw "100 clients" in inference mode
**Clarification**: 
- Max value is 100 (for training mode)
- Input is HIDDEN in inference mode (line 508)
- Only relevant in training mode
- Inference always uses 1 agent

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Typical Evaluation
```
Test Episodes: 50
Duration: ~30 seconds (depends on episode length)
Progress: Real-time updates with progress bar
Visualization: Live rendering on single canvas
```

### Results Display
```

## 🚀 Usage Workflow

### Complete Cycle
1. **Train** (🧠 Training tab)
   - Set clients: 4
   - Enable auto-federate
   - Click Start
   - Wait ~100-200 episodes
   - Click "💾 Save Checkpoint"

2. **Evaluate** (🎯 Inference tab)
   - Auto-switches to single agent
   - Select "Latest Training Session"
   - Choose 50 episodes
   - Click "▶ Run Evaluation"
   - Watch progress bar

3. **Review** (Results panel)
   - Check success rate (target: >80%)
   - Check consistency (target: >70%)
   - Export results if satisfied

4. **Iterate** (Back to 🧠 Training)
   - If performance poor, train more
   - Try different hyperparameters
   - Re-evaluate after changes

## 💾 Model Storage

### localStorage (Automatic)
```javascript
Key: "${appName}-latest"
Value: {
  model: { /* Q-table */ },
  metadata: {
    appName,
    numClients,
    federationRound,
    timestamp
  }
}
```

**Automatically saved:**
- On mode switch (Training → Inference)
- On "Save Checkpoint" button
- Overwritten each time

### File Export (Manual)
```javascript
Filename: "app-name-model-1234567890.json"
Format: {
  version: "1.0",
  timestamp: "2025-10-01T18:42:45.123Z",
  model: { /* Q-table */ },
  metadata: { /* app info */ }
}
```

**Use cases:**
- Share models with others
- Archive specific checkpoints
- Compare different training runs
