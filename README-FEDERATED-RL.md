## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Run Existing Demos

1. **Open the index page:**
   ```bash
   open index-federated-rl.html
   ```

2. **Choose a demo** (Ball Balancing or Cart-Pole)

3. **Configure:**
   - Set number of clients (1-100, default: 16)
   - Click "▶ Start Training"

4. **Enable auto-federation** (optional):
   - Click "🤖 Auto-Federate"
   - System will automatically share knowledge every 50-100 episodes

5. **Export trained model:**
   - Click "💾 Export Model"
   - Save as JSON for production use

### Option B: Build Your Own Demo (NEW! 🚀)

**⚠️ ES6 modules need a server:**
```bash
./start-server.sh
# or: python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000/examples/...
```

Create a complete federated RL app in ~20 lines:

```javascript
import { createFederatedApp } from './components/app-template.js';

createFederatedApp({
  name: 'My Task',
  numClients: 8,
  environment: {
    actions: ['UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT', 'RIGHT'],
    getState: (state) => `${state.x},${state.y}`,
    step: (state, action) => ({ state, reward, done }),
    reset: () => ({ x: 0, y: 0 })
  },
  render: (ctx, state) => { /* draw your environment */ }
}).start();
```

**See:**
- `components/README.md` - Component API documentation
- `COMPONENT-LIBRARY-GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive usage guide
- `examples/grid-world-minimal.html` - Ultra simple example
- `examples/mountain-car.html` - More complex example

## 🎮 Demo 1: Ball Balancing

### Objective
Keep a falling ball centered on a moving platform by shifting LEFT/STAY/RIGHT.

### Key Features
- **Heterogeneous Physics:** Each client has different gravity (±30%), platform speed, friction
- **State Space:** Ball (x, y, vx, vy), Platform (x) → ~3,000-8,000 states
- **Actions:** LEFT, STAY, RIGHT
- **Reward:** Distance-based (closer = better), -100 if ball falls off
- **Convergence:** 100-200 episodes with 16 clients

### Why It's Great for Fed-RL
- Different gravity creates diverse ball trajectories
- Predictive strategies transfer well across clients
- Visual feedback is intuitive (you see the ball bouncing)

## 🎯 Demo 2: Cart-Pole Balance

### Objective
Balance an inverted pendulum on a moving cart by applying LEFT/RIGHT forces.

### Key Features
- **Heterogeneous Physics:** Each client has different pole length (±30%), cart mass (±40%), friction
- **State Space:** Cart (x, ẋ), Pole (θ, θ̇) → ~5,000-10,000 states
- **Actions:** PUSH LEFT, PUSH RIGHT
- **Reward:** +1 per balanced step, -100 if pole falls > 45°
- **Convergence:** 50-100 episodes with 16 clients

### Why It's Great for Fed-RL
- Classic control problem (robotics benchmark since 1960s)
- Universal balancing strategy despite different dynamics
- Dramatic visual failures make learning progress obvious

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Q-Learning (Local Learning)
Each client learns independently using Q-learning:
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max_a'(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]
```

### 2. Federated Averaging (Knowledge Sharing)
Periodically, all clients share Q-tables:
```
θ_global = Σ(n_k / n) · θ_k
```
**Key improvement:** Now includes ALL states from ALL clients (fixed bug!)

### 3. Auto-Federation Algorithm
```
Every 5 seconds:
  avg_episodes = Σ(client_episodes) / num_clients
  IF avg_episodes % 100 == 0:
    → Trigger federation
    → Share Q-tables
    → All clients get combined knowledge
```

### 4. Export/Import/Inference
- **Export:** Save trained Q-table as JSON
- **Import:** Load pre-trained model
- **Inference Mode:** Pure exploitation (ε=0), no learning overhead

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

## 🔧 Architecture

### Modular Design
```javascript
// Pure functional core
updateQValue(currentQ, reward, maxNextQ, alpha, gamma)
selectAction(qValues, epsilon)
federatedAverage(models, weights)

// Dependency injection
createConfig(overrides) → config
createEnvironment(config) → env
createAgent(config, env) → agent

// Composable components
createClient(id, config, env) → client
createFederatedSystem(clients, config) → system
```

### Key Principles
1. **Pure functional math operations** - No side effects
2. **Dependency injection** - Config passed through
3. **Error handling** - Try-catch with graceful degradation
4. **Reusability** - All components can be used independently
