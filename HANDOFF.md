# 🔄 Handoff Document - Federated RL Framework

**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** Async bug fixed, ready for testing  
**Priority Issue:** LLM demo needs verification after async fix

---

## 🚨 Critical Issue (JUST FIXED)

### Problem
LLM demo was throwing errors:
```
TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'state.currentQuestion')
Error: HTTP 406
```

### Root Cause
`app-template.js` didn't support async `step` functions. LLM demo needs async because it calls Ollama API.

### Fix Applied
✅ Made `stepClient` async  
✅ Made `animate` loop async  
✅ Added `instanceof Promise` check to support both sync/async step functions  

**Changed File:** `components/app-template.js` (lines 243-296)

### Next Step
**Test the LLM demo:**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open: http://localhost:8000/examples/federated-llm-learning.html
# Click "Start Training" and verify no errors
```

## ✅ What's Working

### Component Library (Stable)
- ✅ `rl-core.js` - Q-learning algorithm
- ✅ `federated-core.js` - FedAvg (fixed bug where only client 0 was used)
- ✅ `ui-builder.js` - Dashboard UI
- ✅ `app-template.js` - High-level builder (async support added)
- ✅ `physics-engine.js` - Matter.js wrapper

### Demos (Verified Working)
- ✅ Ball Balancing - `ball-balancing/index.html`
- ✅ Cart-Pole - `cart-pole/index.html`
- ✅ Grid World - `examples/grid-world-minimal.html`
- ✅ Mountain Car - `examples/mountain-car.html`
- ✅ Ball Balancing Physics - `examples/ball-balancing-physics.html`
- ✅ Cart-Pole Physics - `examples/cart-pole-physics.html`

### Demos (Need Testing)
- ⚠️ LLM Meta-Learning - `examples/federated-llm-learning.html` (async fix applied)

## 🐛 Known Issues

### 1. LLM Demo (High Priority)
**Status:** Async fix applied, needs testing  
**Error Before:** `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'state.currentQuestion')`  
**Fix:** Made `stepClient` and `animate` async  
**Next:** Verify it works (see Testing section below)

### 2. Performance with Many Clients
**Issue:** >50 clients can slow browser  
**Workaround:** Limit to 16-32 clients for smooth performance  
**Future:** Consider Web Workers for parallel training

### 3. Sequential Async Execution
**Issue:** Async step functions run sequentially (to avoid race conditions)  
**Impact:** LLM demo may train slower than sync demos  
**Trade-off:** Correctness over speed (acceptable for demo)

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Immediate Priority: LLM Demo
```bash
# 1. Start server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# 2. Open browser
http://localhost:8000/examples/federated-llm-learning.html

# 3. Open browser console (check for errors)

# 4. Click "Start Training"
# Expected: No errors, clients start training
# Expected: Questions appear, strategies update
# Expected: Mock LLM responses work

# 5. Test federation
# Click "Federate Models"
# Expected: States learned should sync across clients

# 6. Check metrics
# Expected: Episodes increase, rewards update
```

### Optional: Ollama Integration (Real LLM)
```bash
# 1. Install Ollama (if not already)
brew install ollama

# 2. Pull tiny model
ollama pull tinyllama

# 3. Refresh LLM demo page
# Expected: Console shows "Ollama detected"
# Expected: Real LLM calls work (slower but more realistic)
```

### Verify Other Demos (Quick Smoke Test)
```bash
# Grid World (fastest)
http://localhost:8000/examples/grid-world-minimal.html
# Click Start, verify agents move and learn

# Ball Balancing Physics
http://localhost:8000/examples/ball-balancing-physics.html
# Verify ball falls and platform moves

# Cart-Pole Physics
http://localhost:8000/examples/cart-pole-physics.html
# Verify pole swings and cart moves (gravity works!)
```

## 📚 Key Technical Concepts

### Q-Learning Algorithm
```
Q(s,a) ← Q(s,a) + α[r + γ·max(Q(s',a')) - Q(s,a)]

Where:
  s = current state
  a = action taken
  r = reward received
  s' = next state
  α = learning rate (0.1)
  γ = discount factor (0.99)
```

**Implementation:** `components/rl-core.js:updateQValue()`

### Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
```
θ_global = Σ (n_k / n) · θ_k

Where:
  n_k = number of episodes for client k
  n = total episodes across all clients
  θ_k = Q-table of client k
```

**Implementation:** `components/federated-core.js:federatedAverage()`

**Bug Fixed:** Was only using `models[0]`, now correctly averages all models.

### Async Step Functions (NEW)
```javascript
// Before (sync only)
const { state, reward, done } = environment.step(state, action);

// After (sync + async)
const stepResult = environment.step(state, action);
const { state, reward, done } = stepResult instanceof Promise 
    ? await stepResult 
    : stepResult;
```

**Why:** LLM demo needs to call Ollama API (async), but physics demos are sync.  
**Solution:** Check if result is a Promise, await if yes, use directly if no.

## 🚀 Common Tasks

### Add a New Demo
```javascript
// 1. Create new HTML file in examples/
// 2. Import app-template:
import { createFederatedRLApp } from '../components/app-template.js';

// 3. Define environment:
const environment = {
    actions: ['action1', 'action2'],
    reset: (clientId) => ({ /* initial state */ }),
    step: (state, action) => ({ 
        state: { /* next state */ },
        reward: 0, 
        done: false 
    }),
    getState: (state) => 'state_key'
};

// 4. Create app:
createFederatedRLApp({ environment });
```

### Modify RL Hyperparameters
```javascript
createFederatedRLApp({
    environment,
    alpha: 0.1,        // Learning rate
    gamma: 0.99,       // Discount factor
    epsilon: 1.0,      // Initial exploration
    epsilonDecay: 0.995, // Decay rate
    minEpsilon: 0.01   // Min exploration
});
```

### Debug Federation Issues
```javascript
// In browser console:
window.clients[0].agent.getModel() // View Q-table for client 0
window.clients.map(c => Object.keys(c.agent.getModel()).length) // States per client

// After federation, all should have similar state counts
```

## 🔧 User Preferences (IMPORTANT)

From user rules:
1. **Concise, structured answers** (user has ADHD)

3. **Pure functions for math** with ASCII notation comments
4. **Don't create new files** unless necessary
5. **Update existing files** rather than creating new ones

## 💡 Architecture Insights

### Why Component Library?
**Before:** Each demo = 1000+ lines (RL + Fed + UI)  
**After:** Each demo = 150-200 lines (just environment definition)  
**Benefit:** 80% code reduction, rapid prototyping

### Why Matter.js?
**Before:** Manual Euler integration, tuning nightmare  
**After:** Professional physics engine, realistic dynamics  
**Benefit:** Accurate simulations, saves hours of debugging

### Why LLM Meta-Learning?
**Insight:** Don't train LLMs (slow, expensive), train HOW to use them!  
**Innovation:** RL learns prompt strategies, federation shares knowledge  
**Real-world:** Customer support, education, content generation

## 🤔 Design Decisions

### Async Step Functions
**Decision:** Support both sync and async  
**Rationale:** Physics demos are sync (fast), LLM demo is async (necessary)  
**Trade-off:** Sequential execution (slower) for correctness  
**Alternative:** Parallel execution with careful state management (future)

### Federation Weighting
**Decision:** Weight by episodes (not uniform average)  
**Rationale:** Clients with more experience contribute more  
**Math:** `θ_global = Σ(n_k/n)·θ_k`

### Discretization
**Decision:** Manual state discretization (not automatic)  
**Rationale:** Domain-specific knowledge improves learning  
**Example:** Ball position binned to 10 regions, not raw float

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load module"
**Cause:** Trying to run from `file://` protocol  
**Fix:** Run local server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

### "State keys not matching"
**Cause:** `getState()` returning different formats  
**Fix:** Ensure consistent string keys (e.g., `"pos:5,vel:2"`)

### "Federation not working"
**Cause:** Auto-federation threshold not met  
**Fix:** Manually click "Federate Models" or lower threshold

### "LLM call failed"
**Cause:** Ollama not running or model not downloaded  
**Fix:** Falls back to mock mode automatically (check console)
